##Ipsum Below
A microcontroller is embedded inside of a system to control a singular function in a device. It does this by interpreting data it receives from its I/O peripherals using its central processor. The temporary information that the microcontroller receives is stored in its data memory, where the processor accesses it and uses instructions stored in its program memory to decipher and apply the incoming data. It then uses its I/O peripherals to communicate and enact the appropriate action.

Microcontroller processors can be based on complex instruction set computing (CISC) or reduced instruction set computing (RISC). CISC generally has around 80 instructions while RISC has about 30, as well as more addressing modes, 12-24 compared to RISC's 3-5. While CISC can be easier to implement and has more efficient memory use, it can have performance degradation due to the higher number of clock cycles needed to execute instructions. RISC, which places more emphasis on software, often provides better performance than CISC processors, which put more emphasis on hardware, due to its simplified instruction set and, therefore, increased design simplicity, but because of the emphasis it places on software, the software can be more complex. Which ISC is used varies depending on application.
